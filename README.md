Heroes of Pymoli Data Challenge
When analyzing the data set for the Heroes of Pymoli videogame, there are a few very important takeaways worth noting.
1. When analyzing the data set by demographics, the Heroes of Pymoli game is very male dominated, in fact, males make up 84% of the players. 
2. Even though male's make up a vast majority of the players of the game, women have a higher average purchase price and naturally higher average total purchase per person. Therefore, it may be worth looking into bringing in more female players in order to truly maximise revenue since they are buying at a higher average price. 
3. The age group between 20-24 make up almost half of the percentage of players at 44%. That same age group also has the third highest avg total purchase price per person.
4. Lastly, the most popular item, Final Critic, is also the most profitable items.
